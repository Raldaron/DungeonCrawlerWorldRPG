They’ll sweep you off your feet, show you a night on the town, and leave you with nothing but a hangover and a set of stunningly sensuous footprints. Low alcohol tolerance, but who's counting drinks when you're that good-looking?",

They serve as her emissaries in the mortal realm, tasked with spreading her influence through temptation and desire. In return, they receive her blessings, which enhance their natural charisma and physical prowess.",
      "Long ago, the Incubi were embroiled in the Seduction Wars, a series of conflicts between the various demon factions over control of mortal souls. Their unmatched allure and ability to manipulate dreams made them formidable opponents, leading to their eventual dominance in the realm of temptation."
